Probably, gallery will not look like the layout in the assets folder. I don't whether I can do that but;

Will be 1 or 3 large image at the center of the page. 
There will be 2 arrows both at the top and the bottom
When you push an arrow, it will flow away through that side
And another image comes from opposite side
